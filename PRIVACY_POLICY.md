# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: January 15, 2026**

The **AI Studio Exporter | Obsidian Edition** extension ("the Extension") is dedicated to protecting your privacy. This policy explains our data handling practices.

## 1. Data Collection

The Extension **does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data**.

- All chat extraction and formatting processes occur entirely on your local machine within the browser.
- No conversation data is ever sent to external servers or third-party services.

## 2. Permissions

The Extension requires the following permissions to function:

- `activeTab`: To extract chat data from the AI Studio page you are currently viewing.
- `downloads`: To save the exported files (Markdown, PDF, JSON, TXT) to your computer.
- `hostPermissions`: Specifically for AI Studio domains (`*://aistudio.google.com/*`) to enable the extraction engine.

## 3. Third-Party Services

The Extension interacts only with the Google AI Studio website to perform its core function. We do not integrate with trackers, analytics, or advertising platforms.

## 4. Security

Data refined and exported through the Extension remains under your control. Since no data is transmitted, there is no risk of interception by the Extension developer.

## 5. Contact

If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, you can open an issue on the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/DVRK-ORG/ai-studio-exporter).
